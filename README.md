# Project Statistical Foundations of Machine Learning

_by Arno Moonens (500513, arno.moonens@vub.ac.be) and Jens Nevens (500093, jens.nevens@vub.ac.be)_

We chose the following 4 assignments:

  - 1) Homework #1: Questions 7, 8, 9 and 10 about the Perceptron Learning Algorithm using a synthetic dataset.
  - 4) Homework #6: Questions 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 about Overfitting and Regularization with Weight Decay. The datasets to be used are given in Homework #6.
  - 8) Homework #8: Questions 7 and 8 about Cross Validation. The datasets to be used are given in Homework #8. You can use the software package LIBSVM for this assignment.
  - 9) Homework #8: Questions 9 and 10 about Radial Basis Functions. The datasets to be used are given in Homework #8. You can use the software package LIBSVM for this assignment.

This project is part of the course Statistical Foundations of Machine Learning given at Vrije Universiteit Brussel by Prof. Dr. Bernard Manderick.
